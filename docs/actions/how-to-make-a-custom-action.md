## Default Configs

The default configs can be found [here](https://github.com/Auxilor/Actions/blob/master/eco-core/core-plugin/src/main/resources/actions/).
You can find additional user-created configs on [lrcdb](https://lrcdb.auxilor.io/).

## Config Layout

Each action has its own config file, placed in the `/actions/` folder, and you can add or remove them as you please. There's an example config called `_example.yml` to help you out!

The ID of the Action is the file name. This is what you use in [placeholders](https://plugins.auxilor.io/actions/placeholderapi).
ID's must be lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores only.

## Example Action Config

```yaml
# If the action should be enabled
enabled: true

# Read https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-an-effect
# The effects for the action
effects:
  - id: give_money
    args:
      amount: "0.25 * %victim_max_health%"
    triggers:
      - kill
    filters:
      not_entities:
        - player

# Read https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-a-condition
# The conditions for the action to work
conditions: [ ]
```
The example effect: Pay players for killing non-player entities at a rate of $0.25 per health point.

## Understanding all the sections

**enabled:** If the action is enabled.

### Effects

The effects section is the core functionality of the action. You can configure effects, conditions, filters, mutators and triggers in this section to run globally or individually.

Check out [Configuring an Effect](https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-an-effect) to understand how to configure this section correctly.

For more advanced users or setups, you can configure chains in this section to string together different effects under one trigger. Check out [Configuring an Effect Chain](https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-a-chain) for more info.
