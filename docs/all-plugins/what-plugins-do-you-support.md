Compatibility is a huge part of eco plugins, so naturally we support a large range of plugins. If a plugin you love isn't found here, feel free to ask on the discord to get support added for it!

If a plugin isn't on this list, it doesn't mean it wont work, it just means that there isn't code in eco to directly integrate with it.
