## How to add boosters
Boosters are each config files placed in the `/boosters/` folder, and you can add or remove them as you please. There's an example config called `_example.yml` to help you out!

### Example Booster Config

## Understanding all the sections

**id:** The ID of the booster. This is what you use in commands - ID's must be lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores only.

**name:** The name of the booster, shown to the player.

**duration:** How long the booster lasts for, in ticks: 72000 ticks is 1 hour

**commands:** The commands that will be dispatched when a booster activates/deactivates. You can use %player% as a placeholder.

**messages:** The messages that are broadcast when a booster activates/deactivates. You can use %player% as a placeholder.

**gui:** Config for how the booster looks in gui: the item, the lore, the name, etc..

### Effects + Conditions

Effects are the actual functionality of the booster, and conditions are requirements that a player must meet for the booster to activate for them - so you can make it so a booster only works for a certain type of player, ie only players that have above a certain amount of playtime, or those that only have below a certain balance.
