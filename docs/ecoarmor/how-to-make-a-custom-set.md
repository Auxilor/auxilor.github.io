title: How to make a Armor Set
sidebar_position: 2
---

## Default configs
The default configs can be found [here](https://github.com/Auxilor/EcoArmor/tree/master/eco-core/core-plugin/src/main/resources/sets).
You can find additional user-created configs on [lrcdb](https://lrcdb.auxilor.io/).

## How to add sets
Each set is its own config file, placed in the `/sets/` folder, and you can add or remove them as you please. There's an example config called `_example.yml` to help you out!

The ID of the Armor Set is the file name. This is what you use in commands and in the [Item Lookup System](https://plugins.auxilor.io/all-plugins/the-item-lookup-system).
ID's must be lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores only.

## Example Armor Set Config

```yaml

### Understanding all the sections

**Sounds:** The sounds to play when the armor is equipped and unequipped.

**advancedLore:** The lore added to the armor once it's advanced.

### Effects / AdvancedEffects

The effects section is the core functionality of the Armor Set. You can configure effects, conditions, filters, mutators and triggers in this section to run whilst the full set is worn.

Check out [Configuring an Effect](https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-an-effect) to understand how to configure this section correctly.

For more advanced users or setups, you can configure chains in this section to string together different effects under one trigger. Check out [Configuring an Effect Chain](https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-a-chain) for more info.


## Advancement Shard Config

```yaml
shard:
  item: prismarine_shard unbreaking:1 hide_enchants # The shard item, read more here: https://plugins.auxilor.io/all-plugins/the-item-lookup-system
