## What is EcoBits?

EcoBits is an additional currency plugin that sits alongside your primary currency. You can create
as many currencies as you want, and then use them in plugins like EcoShop, EcoSkills, and anything
else that you use. It has dynamic currency commands that let you access each currency with its own
command, instead of making your players do `/ecobits`, and it's been designed from the ground up to
be the perfect tool to monetize your server.
