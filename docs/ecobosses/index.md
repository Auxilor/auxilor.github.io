## What is EcoBosses?
EcoBosses is a plugin that allows you to make your own custom bosses. Built to be completely customizable and integrate seamlessly with vanilla gameplay, you can modify every aspect of the bosses, create spawn totems and eggs to spawn them in, have them spawn automatically on a timer, set effects and properties, rewards, commands, and much, much more.

It's incredibly easy to configure your own bosses. No more spending hours writing and debugging complex systems or paying people to make them for you, no subscription model or overpriced extras - once you buy it, it's yours forever.
