```yaml
collections:
  # Worlds where collections are disabled (count is not gained, GUI still works)
  disabled-worlds: []

  # If true, count is not gained while AFK (requires eco AFK detection)

  prevent-while-creative: true

  # On plugin load, scan every count-method and log a warning if mine_block or
  # break_block is used without an explicit `player_placed` filter. The plugin
  # itself does not enforce filters — this only emits warnings.
