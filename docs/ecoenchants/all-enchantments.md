## Sidenote

The items that an enchantment can be applied to is configurable, to a certain extent. You can change targets, however the general type should have to be the same. For example, a sword enchantment would work on any melee attack, but it wouldn't work if you set it to use a bow, trident, or armor piece. However, any armor enchant will work on any armor piece.

The listed names are the default display names. Once again, these can be completely customized and translated to your liking.

This list only includes the base custom enchants, not the extra ones you make yourself in customenchants.yml
