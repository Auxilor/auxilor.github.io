## How to:

To export a locale (get a token for your language setup), run this command:

```yaml
/ecoenchants locale export
```

To download a locale, run this command:

```yaml
/ecoenchants locale download <token>
```

The permissions are:

```yaml
ecoenchants.command.locale
ecoenchants.command.locale.download
ecoenchants.command.locale.export
(ecoenchants.command.locale.*)
```

## Why use this

Quite often, people want pre-existing translations of EcoEnchants - and this will allow for that. Say someone has a russian translation - instead of copying over each enchantment file and lang.yml manually, which takes ages, you can simply ask them to export their locale and give you a token, which you can then download.

This massively simplifies translations.
