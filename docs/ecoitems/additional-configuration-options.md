## How to add additional recipes
Each recipe is its own config file, placed in the `/recipes/` folder, and you can add or remove them as you please. There's an example config called `_example.yml` to help you out!

The ID of the recipe is the file name. These currently do not have function, just make sure they're unique.
ID's must be lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores only.

Additional recipes can be used for EcoItems but also for items from other plugins, such as additional recipes for Pet Spawn Eggs from EcoPets, or creating a recipe for Enchanted Golden Apples.
## Example Recipe Config
```yaml
result: ecoitems:enchanted_emerald 9 # The item to give, read here for more: https://plugins.auxilor.io/all-plugins/the-item-lookup-system

## How to add rarities
Each rarity is its own config file, placed in the `/rarities/` folder, and you can add or remove them as you please. There's an example config called `_example.yml` to help you out!

The ID of the rarity is the file name. This is what you use in the EcoItem configs, read here for more: [How to make an Item](https://plugins.auxilor.io/ecoitems/how-to-make-a-custom-item).
ID's must be lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores only.

Rarities in EcoItems are a system for categorizing items based on their rarity level. Each rarity is defined by a specific tag in lore to show players which items are harder to obtain and/or which loot items are better.

## Example Rarity Config

```yaml
# The ID of the rarity is the name of the .yml file,
# for example common.yml has the ID of common
# You can place rarities anywhere in this folder,
# including in subfolders if you want to organize your rarity configs
# _example.yml is not loaded.

# The lore added to items with this rarity
lore:
  - "&a&lCOMMON"

# The weight of the rarity. Higher weights take precedence over lower weights,
# so if an item has multiple rarities, the one with the highest weight will be used.
weight: 1

# The items that have this rarity
# Read here: https://plugins.auxilor.io/all-plugins/the-item-lookup-system
# EcoItems items should specify the rarity in their config rather than here
items:
  - diamond
```
