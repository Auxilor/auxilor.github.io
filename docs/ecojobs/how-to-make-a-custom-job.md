## Default configs
The default configs can be found [here](https://github.com/Auxilor/EcoJobs/tree/master/eco-core/core-plugin/src/main/resources/jobs).
You can find additional user-created configs on [lrcdb](https://lrcdb.auxilor.io/).

## How to add jobs
Each job is its own config file, placed in the `/jobs/` folder, and you can add or remove them as you please. There's an example config called `_example.yml` to help you out!

The ID of the Job is the file name. This is what you use in commands, effects and placeholders.
ID's must be lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores only.

## Example Job Config

```yaml
name: "&6Miner" # The display name of the job
description: "&8&oLevel up by mining blocks" # The description of the job
unlocked-by-default: true # If the job should be unlocked by default
reset-on-quit: false # If job progress should be reset when quitting

# The price to join this job (set to 0 to disable)
# Read here for more: https://plugins.auxilor.io/all-plugins/prices
join-price:
  value: 0
  type: coins
  display: "&a$%value%"

# Lore shown when clicking on the job icon to join it
# Reference with %join_lore%
join-lore: []

# A list of effects to run when the player joins the job.
# Read https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-an-effect
join-effects:
  - id: broadcast
    args:
      message: "&8» &a%player% &8joined the &6Miner &8job!"

# The price to leave this job (set to 0 to disable)
# Read here for more: https://plugins.auxilor.io/all-plugins/prices
leave-price:
  value: 20000
  type: coins
  display: "&a$%value%"
  
# A list of effects to run when the player leaves the job.

# Lore shown on the confirm leave button
# Reference with %leave_lore%
leave-lore:
  - " &8» This will cost %leave_price%"

# There are two ways to specify level XP requirements:  
# 1. A formula to calculate for infinite levels  
# 2. A list of XP requirements for each level  
  
# Formula  
# xp-formula: (2 ^ %level%) * 25  
# max-level: 100 # (Optional) The max level, if not specified, there is no max level  
  
# List

# An XP gain method takes a trigger, a multiplier, conditions, and filters.
# The 'multiplier' takes the value produced by the trigger and multiplies it
# Alternatively, you can use 'value' to count a specific number and not a multiplier

  - trigger: mine_block
    multiplier: 0.5 # You can also use "value" here (see above comment)

### Effects & Conditions

You can configure effects, conditions, filters, and mutators in this section to run when the job is levelled up.

Check out [Configuring an Effect](https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-an-effect) to understand how to configure this section correctly.

For more advanced users or setups, you can configure chains in this section to string together different effects under one trigger. Check out [Configuring an Effect Chain](https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-a-chain) for more info.
