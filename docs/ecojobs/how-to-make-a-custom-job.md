## Default config

The default configs can be found here:

[GitHub](https://github.com/Auxilor/EcoJobs/blob/master/eco-core/core-plugin/src/main/resources/jobs/)

## How to add jobs
Jobs are each config files placed in the `/jobs/` folder, and you can add or remove them as you please. There's an example config called `_example.yml` to help you out!

## Typical Job Config

```yaml
# The ID of the job is the name of the .yml file,
# for example miner.yml has the ID of miner
# You can place jobs anywhere in this folder,
# including in subfolders if you want to organize your job configs
# _example.yml is not loaded.

# The display name of the job
name: "&6Miner"

# The description of the job
description: "&8&oLevel up by mining blocks"

# If the job should be unlocked by default
unlocked-by-default: true

# If job progress should be reset when quitting
reset-on-quit: false

# The price to join this job (set to 0 to disable)
# Read here for more: https://plugins.auxilor.io/all-plugins/prices
join-price:
  value: 0
  type: coins
  display: "&a$%value%"

# Lore shown when clicking on the job icon to join it
# Reference with %join_lore%
join-lore: []

# The price to leave this job (set to 0 to disable)
# Read here for more: https://plugins.auxilor.io/all-plugins/prices

## Understanding all the sections

**id:** The ID of the job. This is what you use in commands - ID's must be lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores only.

**name:** The name of the job, shown to the player.

**description:** The description of the job, helpful to show how it's levelled.

**unlocked-by-default:** If the job should be available to all players by default, or if they should have to unlock it.

**level-xp-requirements:** The XP requirements for each level

**xp-gain-methods:** The way the job can be levelled. Each ID is a trigger - triggers give values such as damage dealt (with attack triggers), distance moved (with the move trigger), etc.. Other triggers with no obvious value give an output of 1.

**level-placeholders:** Custom placeholders for messages / lore

**effects-description:** Job specific effect descriptions

**rewards-description:** Job specific reward descriptions

**level-up-messages:** Job specific level up messages

**level-commands:** Commands to be executed on levelup 

**icon:** The GUI icon

### Effects & Conditions

Effects are the actual functionality of the job, and conditions are requirements that a player must meet for the job to activate for them - so you can make it so a job only works for a certain type of player, ie only players that have above a certain amount of playtime, or those that only have below a certain balance.

See this page for how to configure effects:
