## Default config
The default configs can be found [here](https://github.com/Auxilor/EcoMobs/tree/master/eco-core/core-plugin/src/main/resources/mobs).
You can find additional user-created configs on [lrcdb](https://lrcdb.auxilor.io/).

## How to add mobs
Each mob is its own config file, placed in the `/mobs/` folder, and you can add or remove them as you please. There's an example config called `_example.yml` to help you out!

The ID of the mob is the file name. This is what you use in commands, effects, the [Entity Lookup System](https://plugins.auxilor.io/all-plugins/the-entity-lookup-system) and in the [Item Lookup System](https://plugins.auxilor.io/all-plugins/the-item-lookup-system).
ID's must be lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores only.
