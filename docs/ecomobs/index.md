## What is EcoMobs?
EcoMobs is a plugin that allows you to make your own custom mobs.
Built to be completely customizable and integrate seamlessly with vanilla gameplay,
you can modify every aspect of the mobs, create spawn totems and eggs to spawn them in,
have them spawn naturally in the world, set effects and properties, rewards, commands, and much, much more.

It's incredibly easy to configure your own mobs. No more spending hours writing and
debugging complex systems or paying people to make them for you, no subscription model
or overpriced extras - once you buy it, it's yours forever.
