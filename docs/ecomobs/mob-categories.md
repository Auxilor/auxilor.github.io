## What are categories?

In EcoMobs, each mob belongs to a category, which control things like spawning behaviour.

For example, you might have a category for common mobs, one for rare mobs, one for nether bosses,
etc.

## How to add categories
Categories are each config files placed in the `/categories/` folder, and you can add or remove them as you please. There's an example config called `_example.yml` to help you out!

## Example Mob Config

```yaml
```
