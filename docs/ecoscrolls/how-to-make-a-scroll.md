## Default configs
The default configs can be found [here](https://github.com/Auxilor/EcoScrolls/tree/master/eco-core/core-plugin/src/main/resources/scrolls).
You can find additional user-created configs on [lrcdb](https://lrcdb.auxilor.io/).

## How to add scrolls
Each scroll is its own config file, placed in the `/scrolls/` folder, and you can add or remove them as you please. There's an example config called `_example.yml` to help you out!

The ID of the Scroll is the file name. This is what you use in commands and placeholders.
ID's must be lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores only.

## Example Scroll Config

```yaml
# The ID of the scroll is the name of the .yml file,
# for example coins_on_kill.yml has the ID of coins_on_kill
# You can place scrolls anywhere in this folder,
# including in subfolders if you want to organize your scroll configs
# _example.yml is not loaded.

name: "&6Example Scroll" # The name of the scroll
lore: # The lore added to items when inscribed with the scroll
  - ""
  - "&7This item has been inscribed with"
  - "&6Example Scroll"

targets: # The items that the scroll can be applied to, see targets.yml
  - sword
conflicts: [ ] # The conflicts that the scroll has with other scrolls

# The scroll(s) that must be applied to the item before this scroll can be applied
requirements:
  - scroll: my_requirement_scroll # The ID of scroll to require
    level: 2 # The level required (optional)
remove-requirements: false # If inscribing this scroll should remove the required scrolls

max-level: 1 # The max level of the scroll
max-uses: 1 # The amount of times the scroll can be used

# Item placeholders for dynamic lore in plugins like EcoItems
# The placeholder is %ecoscrolls_scroll_<scroll>:<placeholder>%, e.g.
# %ecoscrolls_scroll_example:bonus%
placeholders:
  bonus: "%level% * 2"

  craftable: false
  recipe: [ ]

# Options for inscribing items with the scroll

  # The price to inscribe the item
  price:

  # The formula to multiply the price depending on the level.
  # The %level% placeholder is the *current* level of the scroll
  price-level-multiplier: "1 + %level% * 0.5"

  # The conditions required to inscribe the item
  # not-met-effects will run if someone tries to inscribe the item without meeting the conditions
  conditions: [ ]

  # The effects that will be run when the item is inscribed
  # If your scroll works by modifying the item (e.g. adding enchantments, changing durability),
  # then put those effects here.
  effects: [ ]
```

### Effects & Conditions

The effects section is the core functionality of the EcoScroll. You can configure effects, conditions, filters, mutators and triggers in this section to run whilst the inscribed item is held or used.

Check out [Configuring an Effect](https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-an-effect) to understand how to configure this section correctly.

For more advanced users or setups, you can configure chains in this section to string together different effects under one trigger. Check out [Configuring an Effect Chain](https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-a-chain) for more info.
