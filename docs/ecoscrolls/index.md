## What is EcoScrolls?

EcoScrolls is a plugin that adds item modifiers to your server. You can make custom item buffs, repeatable modifiers
(e.g. Hot Potato Books), drag-and-drop upgrades, and more. There's also a new GUI called the Inscription Table that you
can use to add these scrolls if you so desire.
