# Other Commands and Permissions

Shops each have their own command that you specify in config,
and they have the `ecoshop.open.<id>` permission, for example `/shop` would
have `ecoshop.open.shop` as its permission.

If you want to make buying/selling an item require a permission,
the permission nodes are `ecoshop.buy.<id>` and `ecoshop.sell.<id>`.
By default, all players have this permission.
