## What is EcoSkills?

EcoSkills allows for an RPG-like experience on your server: with skill levelling, special effects / abilities, MMO
stats, magic types like Mana, brand new mechanics, and more complex competition! It's been inspired by Hypixel Skyblock,
if you're familiar with that.

It works on bungee / velocity with MySQL!

## What sets EcoSkills apart from other skill plugins?

EcoSkills is the most configurable skills plugin ever released. You can create your own skills, stats, effects, magic
types, you can redesign every GUI, change literally every aspect of anything that exists in the default config.
It's also completely Plug-and-Play, so if you don't want to configure everything, you don't have to!
