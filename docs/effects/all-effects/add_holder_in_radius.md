# `add_holder_in_radius`
#### Triggered Effect

Gives a custom holder temporarily for a given period of time

A holder is anything with effects and conditions, in plugins typically a Talisman, Armor Set, etc.

You can create custom holders temporarily and give them on a trigger, for example to give permanent effects for a period of time to people around you.

# Example Config
```yaml
- id: add_holder_in_radius
  args:
    effects: 
      - id: movement_speed_multiplier
        args:
          multiplier: 1.25
    conditions: []
    duration: 300 # The duration, in ticks
    radius: 5.3 # The radius, in blocks
    apply-to-self: false # If the player should also get the holder (Defaults to false)
  ...other config (eg triggers, filters, mutators, etc)
```
