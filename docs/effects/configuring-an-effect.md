## Example Effect Config

```yaml
id: spawn_particle
args:
    amount: 10
    chance: 25
    particle: soul
triggers:
    - mine_block
filters:
    blocks:
        - diamond_ore
        - ancient_debris
conditions: [ ]
mutators:
    - id: translate_location
      args:
          add_x: 0.5
          add_y: 0.5
          add_z: 0.5
```

This is an effect that gives you a 10% chance to spawn 10 soul particles in the middle of a block of diamond ore or
ancient debris when it's mined

## Placeholders

**Any numeric value (integer, decimal) can be a mathematical expression involving placeholders!**

For example, you can specify the chance to be dependent on your y level: as in `chance: 100 - %player_y%` - permanent
effects will evaluate the expression on activation, and triggered effects will evaluate it on each trigger. Make sure
you only use placeholders with numeric values, as you will get weird behaviour otherwise.

There are also extra placeholders passed in that you can use:

`%trigger_value%`, `%triggervalue%`, `%trigger%`, `%value%`, `%tv%`, `%v%`, and `%t%`: The value passed by the trigger (
e.g. the amount of damage dealt; see [here](https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/all-triggers)).

`%victim_health%`: The victim's health

`%victim_max_health%`: The victim's max health

`%distance%`: The distance between the player and the victim

`%victim_level%`: The victim's level **Requires LevelledMobs**

If the victim is a player, you can supply any placeholder prefixed with `victim_` (e.g. `%victim_player_y%`) as well.

`%hits%`: The amount of times the player has hit the victim

`%text%`, `%string%`, and `%message%`: The message text from the trigger, for example a chat message

`%location_x%`, `%loc_x%`, and `%x%`: The x-coordinate of the location

`%location_block_x%`, `%loc_b_x%`, `%block_x%`, and `%bx%`: The block x-coordinate of the location

`%location_y%`, `%loc_y%`, and `%y%`: The y-coordinate of the location

`%location_block_y%`, `%loc_b_y%`, `%block_y%`, and `%by%`: The block y-coordinate of the location

`%location_z%`, `%loc_z%`, and `%z%`: The z-coordinate of the location

`%location_block_z%`, `%loc_b_z%`, `%block_z%`, and `%bz%`: The block z-coordinate of the location

`%location_world%`, `%loc_w%`, and `%world%`: The world name of the location

## The Sections

**id**: The effect ID. A list of ID's and their corresponding arguments can be
found [here](https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/all-effects)

**args**: The arguments. All (triggerable) effects have optional arguments (see below)
git add
**triggers**: The list of triggers that activate this effect. If the effect is permanent (see next page) then this
section is not applicable

**filters**: The list of filters against arguments created by the trigger, ie mine_block will provide blocks to be
filtered, melee_attack will provide entities to be filtered.

**conditions**: As well as each effect holder (eg Talisman, Reforge, Enchant) having its own conditions, you can specify
a list of effect-specific conditions that work in exactly the same way

**mutators**: Mutate the data sent to the effect: you can change parameters such as the victim, the location, et cetera.
A mutator, like an effect or condition, consists of an ID and arguments.

## Optional Arguments

#### `chance`

The chance of this effect activating, as a percentage. (defaults to 100)

```yaml
args:
    chance: 50
```

#### `cooldown`

The cooldown between effect activations, in seconds. (defaults to 0)

```yaml
args:
    cooldown: 10
    send_cooldown_message: true # (Optional) If the cooldown message should be sent
    cooldown_message: "Custom cooldown message with %seconds% left" # (Optional) a custom cooldown message
```

#### `cost`

The cost required to use or activate this effect. **Requires Vault.** (defaults to 0)

```yaml
args:
    cost: 200
```

#### `every`

Specify the effect to activate every x times. (defaults to always)

```yaml
args:
    every: 3
```

#### `mana_cost`

The mana cost required to use or activate this effect. **Requires Aurelium Skills.** (defaults to 0)

```yaml
args:
    mana_cost: 10
```

#### `<magic>_cost`

The magic cost (e.g. mana) required to use or activate this effect. **Requires EcoSkills.** (defaults to 0)

```yaml
args:
    mana_cost: 10
```

#### `delay`

The amount of ticks to wait before executing the effect. (defaults to 0)

```yaml
args:
    delay: 20
```

#### `filters_before_mutation`

By default, filters are ran after mutation - set this to true if filters should be ran on the un-mutated data. (defaults
to false)

```yaml
args:
    filters_before_mutation: true
```

#### `disable_antigrief_check`

By default, the antigrief plugins on your server are checked. Set this to true to disable that. (defaults to false)

```yaml
args:
    disable_antigrief_check: true
```

#### `point_cost`

The point cost required to use or activate this effect, looks like this in config:

```yaml
args:
    point_cost:
        cost: 100 * %player_y%
        type: g_souls
```

#### `price`

The price required to use or activate this effect.

This supports all known prices: supports money, items, points, second currencies, etc.
Read more about the system here: https://plugins.auxilor.io/all-plugins/prices

Looks like this in config:

```yaml
args:
    price:
        value: 100 * %player_y%
        type: crystals
        display: "&b%value% Crystals ‚ùñ"
```

#### `weight`

The weight (chance) of this effect firing if the chain is ran randomly.

Chance is calculated as `<weight of element> / <sum of all weights>`

```yaml
args:
    weight: 10
```

## Effect Chains

Effect chains are groups of effects that can be executed together. This is very useful if you want to create a
chance-based effect with several components: chance is calculated independently on each trigger, so without chains,
particles and messages could send when the effects don't activate, and vice-versa.

Effect chains are also useful to re-use more complex logic, via custom arguments that you can specify.
These work like regular placeholders, and you reference them in your chains with `%<id>%`, for example `%size%` if you
had a size argument.

You can create a chain in config, under the 'chains' section - which should look like this:

```yaml
chains:
    - id: <chain id>
      effects:
          - <effect 1>
          - <effect 2>
          - <effect 3>
```

**Effects in chains do not need to specify triggers as they are triggered by the run_chain effect**

You can add or remove as many chains as you want. Then, if you want to call a chain, use the `run_chain` effect, like
this:

```yaml
id: run_chain
args:
    chance: 50 * (%player_health% / 20) # Example to demonstrate placeholders in config
    cooldown: 2
    chain: <chain id>
triggers:
    - melee_attack
    - bow_attack
    - trident_attack
filters:
    entities:
        - zombie
        - creeper charged
        - skeleton
```

Custom arguments can be specified like this:

```yaml
id: run_chain
args:
    chain: <chain id>
    chain_args:
        strength: %player_y% * 100 # You can put anything you want, doesn't only have to be numbers - you can use strings too!
        ... add whichever arguments you use in your chain
```

If you don't want to re-use chains, or if you prefer having them specified directly under the effect, you can specify
effects like this instead:

```yaml
effects:
    - <effect 1>
    - <effect 2>
    - <effect 3>
triggers:
    - mine_block
args:
    every: 3
```

Inline chains also support custom arguments, just like regular chains.

Effects in chains run isolated, so applying a mutator to one effect in the chain will apply it only to that effect -
however, you can specify a mutator to the parent effect which will be applied to all
effects in the chain. The same works for delays, e.g. if an effect in a chain has a delay of 2, it won't hold up other
effects down the chain.

Effect chains also support several run types:

- **normal**: All effects in the chain will be ran, one after another
- **cycle**: Only one effect will be ran, and it cycles through each effect each time the chain is ran
- **random**: Only one effect will be ran, chosen at random on each execution

To specify the run type, add the `run-type` argument into config:

```yml
effects:
    - triggers:
          - alt_click
      effects:
          - <effect 1>
          - <effect 2>
          - <effect 3>
      args:
          run-type: random
          chance: 30
... filters, mutators, etc
```

This is an alternative way of configuring your effects; you don't specify a top-level effect ID, instead you specify a
list of effects to be called. This can be thought of as being more trigger-centric; multiple triggers to multiple
effects straight away, no worrying about the underlying inline chain.

These work exactly like inline chains (they are inline chains), so everything is still supported; run-type, custom
arguments, et cetera.

## Load Weight

All configs are loaded alphabetically by default. However, if you have a config that depends on
another one, for example an EcoItems item thats crafted with another EcoItems item, you can add
`load-weight: <weight>`. All configs have a default load weight of 100, and it's loaded in ascending
order, so a config with a load weight of 10 is loaded before a load weight of 20.
