You can create custom placeholders to reuse mathematical expressions or to have global
data shared between plugins.

These are in libreforge's config.yml, and look like this:

> [!example]
> ```yaml
> placeholders:
>     - id: "example_placeholder" # The placeholder ID
>       value: "This is an example placeholder!" # The value of the placeholder
> 
>     - id: "example_expression_placeholder"
>       value: "%level% * 2" # Mathematical expressions are fully supported!
> 
>     - id: "conditional_placeholder"
>       default: 5 # (Optional) Specify a default value if no conditions are true
>       values:
>           - conditions: # Full condition system support!
>                 - id: has_permission
>                   args:
>                       permission: "ecomc.rank.netherite"
>             value: 20
>           - conditions:
>                 - id: has_permission
>                   args:
>                       permission: "ecomc.rank.diamond"
>             value: 10
> ```

You can create as many placeholders as you want by adding to the list.

Placeholders can be referenced with `%libreforge_<id>%`, and are fully supported with PlaceholderAPI.
