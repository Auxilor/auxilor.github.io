You can create custom placeholders to reuse mathematical expressions or to have global
data shared between plugins.

These are in libreforge's config.yml, and look like this:

```yaml
placeholders:
    - id: "example_placeholder" # The placeholder ID
      value: "This is an example placeholder!" # The value of the placeholder

    - id: "example_expression_placeholder"
      value: "%level% * 2" # Mathematical expressions are fully supported!

    - id: "conditional_placeholder"
      default: 5 # (Optional) Specify a default value if no conditions are true
      values:
          - conditions: # Full condition system support!
                - id: has_permission
                  args:
                      permission: "ecomc.rank.netherite"
            value: 20

          - conditions:
                - id: has_permission
                  args:
                      permission: "ecomc.rank.diamond"
            value: 10
```

You can create as many placeholders as you want by adding to the list.

Placeholders can be referenced with `%libreforge_<id>%`, and are fully supported with PlaceholderAPI.
