Points are similar to currencies, however they exist purely as a way to keep track of something in a player. For example, lets say you want the player to have to used an item a certain amount of times in order to use another one - you would be able to keep track of this with a point.

You can have as many different points as you want, the plugins will keep track of them automatically. Points are shared between plugins, too - so if you make a point in EcoItems, then you can use it in EcoPets, EcoJobs, etc.

A point can hold any numeric value, including negatives and decimals, but of course how you decide to use them is completely up to you.

> | Points        | `%libreforge_points_<point>%`        | A general point that can be used to keep track of something per-player.

> | Item Points   | `%libreforge_item_points_<point>%`   | A point that is tied to a specific item and tracks data on the item.
