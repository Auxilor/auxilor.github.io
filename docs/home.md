## What is eco?
eco is the development library that powers all eco plugins. It handles a wide range of backend features, and allows eco plugins to be as powerful as they are. However, it means that you have to install it as a separate plugin on your server.

### How do I install it?

It's just like any other plugin on your server. Drop it into the /plugins/ folder and restart the server. However, eco also needs ProtocolLib to function - if you don't already have it on your server, make sure to grab the latest version [here](https://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib/lastSuccessfulBuild/)

Download the latest version of eco from [GitHub](https://github.com/Auxilor/eco/releases) or [Polymart](https://polymart.org/resource/1-16-1-17-eco.773)

## Where should I buy the plugins?
All plugins are available on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/auxilor.507394/) and [Polymart](https://polymart.org/user/auxilor.1107), and you can buy plugins at a 25% discount in a bundle, too - [click here to get them!](https://polymart.org/bundle/eco-pack.110)

### All information in this documentation is for the latest plugin versions. Older versions may not contain all features and options shown.
